  This site is aimed mostly at myself. I enjoy working on projects. The act of publishing
  something to this web site provides some closure and sense of accomplishment. Having
  publication as a possibility helps to focus my efforts. Every now and then I settle
  down and actually finish something.
  
  From time to time I also may produce something that is of interest to an outside
  audience. Many times I have learned something useful after a web search has landed me on some
  stranger's writing on the web. I hope this site may prove useful to others who stumble across it.

  Thank you to Alison Presmanes Hill and RStudio for creating the [Hugo Ap√©ro theme](https://hugo-apero.netlify.app) which has nudged me to attempt a more expressive and attractive site.
